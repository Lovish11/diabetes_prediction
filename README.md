# Diabetes_prediction

## Objective
* To predict that person is suffering from diabetes or not from following features :- 
        * No. of Pregnancies
        * Glucose
        * BloodPressure
        * SkinThickness
        * Insulin
        * BMI
        * DiabetesPedigreeFunction
        * Age
## Data Source
        * https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
## Problem Type :- Classification 
## Libraries Used
        * sklearn
        * xgboost
        * numpy
        * pandas
        * seaborn
        * matplotlib
       
## What Can Be Achieved :
        * From This we can make a model to predict the risk of diabetes i.e. what is the probability that a person can have diabetes in future so that he/she can improve his routine to be safe. Will be shortly working on that.
